# HttpApi migration

Plan for replacing instance Hono route implementations with Effect `HttpApi` while preserving behavior, OpenAPI, and SDK output during the transition.

## End State

- JSON route contracts and handlers live in `src/server/routes/instance/httpapi/*`.
- Route modules own their `HttpApiGroup`, schemas, handlers, and route-level middleware.
- `httpapi/server.ts` only composes groups, instance lookup, observability, and the web handler bridge.
- Hono route implementations are deleted once their `HttpApi` replacements are default, tested, and represented in the SDK/OpenAPI pipeline.
- Streaming, SSE, and websocket routes move later through Effect HTTP primitives or another explicit replacement plan; they do not need to fit `HttpApi` if `HttpApi` is the wrong abstraction.

## Current State

- `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTPAPI` gates the bridge. Default behavior still uses Hono.
- The bridge mounts selected paths in `server/routes/instance/index.ts` before legacy Hono routes.
- Legacy Hono routes remain for default behavior and for `hono-openapi` SDK generation.
- `HttpApi` auth is independent of Hono auth.
- `Authorization` is attached in each route module, not centrally wrapped in `server.ts`.
- Auth supports Basic auth and the legacy `auth_token` query parameter through `HttpApiSecurity.apiKey`.
- Instance context is provided by `httpapi/server.ts` using `directory`, `workspace`, and `x-opencode-directory`.
- `Observability.layer` is provided in the Effect route layer and deduplicated through the shared `memoMap`.

## Migration Rules

- Preserve runtime behavior first. Semantic changes, new error behavior, or route shape changes need separate PRs.
- Migrate one route group, or one coherent subset of a route group, at a time.
- Reuse existing services. Do not re-architect service logic during HTTP boundary migration.
- Effect Schema owns route DTOs. Keep `.zod` only as compatibility for remaining Hono/OpenAPI surfaces.
- Regenerate the SDK after schema or OpenAPI-affecting changes and verify the diff is expected.
- Do not delete a Hono route until the SDK/OpenAPI pipeline no longer depends on its Hono `describeRoute` entry.

## Route Slice Checklist

Use this checklist for each small HttpApi migration PR:

1. Read the legacy Hono route and copy behavior exactly, including default values, headers, operation IDs, response schemas, and status codes.
2. Put the new `HttpApiGroup`, route paths, DTO schemas, and handlers in `src/server/routes/instance/httpapi/*`.
3. Mount the new paths in `src/server/routes/instance/index.ts` only inside the `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTPAPI` block.
4. Use `InstanceState.context` / `InstanceState.directory` inside HttpApi handlers instead of `Instance.directory`, `Instance.worktree`, or `Instance.project` ALS globals.
5. Reuse existing services directly. If a service returns plain objects, use `Schema.Struct`; use `Schema.Class` only when handlers return actual class instances.
6. Keep legacy Hono routes and `.zod` compatibility in place for SDK/OpenAPI generation.
7. Add tests that hit the Hono-mounted bridge via `InstanceRoutes`, not only the raw `HttpApi` web handler, when the route depends on auth or instance context.
8. Run `bun typecheck` from `packages/opencode`, relevant `bun run test:ci ...` tests from `packages/opencode`, and `./packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts` from the repo root.

## Experimental Read Slice Guidance

For the experimental route group, port read-only JSON routes before mutations:

- Good first batch: `GET /console`, `GET /console/orgs`, `GET /tool/ids`, `GET /resource`.
- Consider `GET /worktree` only if the handler uses `InstanceState.context` instead of `Instance.project`.
- Defer `POST /console/switch`, worktree create/remove/reset, and `GET /session` to separate PRs because they mutate state or have broader pagination/session behavior.
- Preserve response headers such as pagination cursors if a route is ported.
- If SDK generation changes, explain whether it is a semantic contract change or a generator-equivalent type normalization.

## Schema Notes

- Use `Schema.Struct(...).annotate({ identifier })` for named OpenAPI refs when handlers return plain objects.
- Use `Schema.Class` only when the handler returns real class instances or the constructor requirement is intentional.
- Keep nested anonymous shapes as `Schema.Struct` unless a named SDK type is useful.
- Avoid parallel hand-written Zod and Effect definitions for the same route boundary.

## Phases

### 1. Stabilize The Bridge

Before porting more routes, cover the bridge behavior that every route depends on.

- Add tests that hit the Hono-mounted `HttpApi` bridge, not just `HttpApiBuilder.layer` directly.
- Cover auth disabled, Basic auth success, `auth_token` success, missing credentials, and bad credentials.
- Cover `directory` and `x-opencode-directory` instance selection.
- Verify generated SDK output remains unchanged for non-SDK work.
- Fix or remove any implemented-but-unmounted `HttpApi` groups.

### 2. Complete The Inventory

Create a route inventory from the actual Hono registrations and classify each route.

Statuses:

- `bridged`: served through the `HttpApi` bridge when the flag is on.
- `implemented`: `HttpApi` group exists but is not mounted through Hono.
- `next`: good JSON candidate for near-term porting.
- `later`: portable, but needs schema/service cleanup first.
- `special`: SSE, websocket, streaming, or UI bridge behavior that likely needs raw Effect HTTP rather than `HttpApi`.

### 3. Finish JSON Route Parity

Port remaining JSON routes in small batches.

Good near-term candidates:

- top-level reads: `GET /path`, `GET /vcs`, `GET /vcs/diff`, `GET /command`, `GET /agent`, `GET /skill`, `GET /lsp`, `GET /formatter`
- simple mutations: `POST /instance/dispose`
- experimental JSON reads: console, tool, worktree list, resource list
- deferred JSON mutations: `PATCH /config`, project git init, workspace/worktree create/remove/reset, file search, MCP auth flows

Keep large or stateful groups for later:

- `session`
- `sync`
- process-level experimental routes

### 4. Move OpenAPI And SDK Generation

Hono routes cannot be deleted while `hono-openapi` is the source of SDK generation.

Required before route deletion:

- Generate the public OpenAPI surface from Effect `HttpApi` for ported routes.
- Keep operation IDs, schemas, status codes, and SDK type names stable unless the change is intentional.
- Compare generated SDK output against `dev` for every route group deletion.
- Remove Hono OpenAPI stubs only after Effect OpenAPI is the SDK source for those paths.

### 5. Make HttpApi Default For JSON Routes

After JSON parity and SDK generation are covered:

- Flip the bridge default for ported JSON routes.
- Keep a short-lived fallback flag for the old Hono implementation.
- Run the same tests against both the default and fallback path during rollout.
- Stop adding new Hono handlers for JSON routes once the default flips.

### 6. Delete Hono Route Implementations

Delete Hono routes group-by-group after each group meets the deletion criteria.

Deletion criteria:

- `HttpApi` route is mounted by default.
- Behavior is covered by bridge-level tests.
- OpenAPI/SDK generation comes from Effect for that path.
- SDK diff is zero or explicitly accepted.
- Legacy Hono route is no longer needed as a fallback.

After deleting a group:

- Remove its Hono route file or dead endpoints.
- Remove its `.route(...)` registration from `instance/index.ts`.
- Remove duplicate Zod-only route DTOs if Effect Schema now owns the type.
- Regenerate SDK and verify output.

### 7. Replace Special Routes

Special routes need explicit designs before Hono can disappear completely.

- `event`: SSE
- `pty`: websocket
- `tui`: UI/control bridge behavior
- streaming `session` endpoints

Use raw Effect HTTP routes where `HttpApi` does not fit. The goal is deleting Hono implementations, not forcing every transport shape through `HttpApi`.
